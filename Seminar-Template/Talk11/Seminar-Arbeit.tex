\section{Introduction and Problem Statement}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Introduction into the topic
	\end{itemize}

The goal of this paper is fourfold, first a common ground is built, with the definitions and characterizations of IoT, business models and business model frameworks. Second, the basic business model framework concepts ``magic triangle'' and  Business Model Canvas are introduced. Third, the changes that were made to business model frameworks due to the development if IoT are highlighted, and lastly, the currently available IoT business model frameworks are presented and compared against each other.\\
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 1.2 the term `Internet of Things' is introduced and its definition, growth, architecture and potential of IoT for business evaluated. Section 1.3 presents the concept of business models and business model frameworks. Along with the definitions, two major `classic' business model frameworks are described. Section 1.4 shows available business model frameworks that are adapted for IoT, Section 1.5 will compare those frameworks and illustrate the results based on a model company. Finally, in Section 1.6 will evaluate the findings of the previous sections, the summery and conclusion will be presented in Section 1.7. 
 
\section{Internet of Things}
The term ``Internet of Things'' (IoT) has grown to one of the most discussed topics in academia and industry \cite{ju}. The phrasing was first used by Kevin Ashton during a presentation in 1999. From there IoT has become a new paradigm, it basically means the ``interconnection of physical objects, by equipping them with sensors, actuators and a means to connect to the Internet'' \cite{dijkman}.\\
Even though the term ``Internet of Things'' is currently used by everyone, there is no common consent about its definition. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) defined IoT 2012 in a recommendation as ``a global infrastructure for the information Society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual) things based on, existing and evolving, inter-operable information and communication technologies'' \cite{itu}. Besides their view on IoT, other definitions were built, Atzori et al. identified three visions how IoT may be seen. As illustrated in Figure 1.x one is focused on the `things' getting connected over technologies like RFID, WLAN or NCF. The second visions is `Internet oriented', where anything connects with anyone . The third point of view is a `semantic oriented' vision, definitions in this direction can be found in literature. The the semantic oriented vision present thoughts on problems generated through the extremely increased number of connected `things', e.g. the challenging issues related to the representation, storage, interconnection, search and organization of information from IoT \cite{atzori}.\\
Due to the differences in these visions, the definitions of IoT established by organizations or entities vary a lot depending on their specific interests, approach taken on the subject as well as their backgrounds. The convergence of these three visions illustrated in Figure 1.x can be seen as the overall paradigm of IoT, this is also the perspective this paper takes  on in the remaining sections.

  \end{figure}

The number of worldwide connected `things' is rapidly growing, in 2016 Gartner predicted up to 6.4 billion connected devices which will reach up to 20.8 billion by 2020 \cite{gartner}. Consequently organizations are more and more involved in IoT-related products, applications and services either in the development or as an investment \cite{ju}. Google acquired Nest for \$3.2 billion, a quickly growing smart thermostat company. Samsung bought SmartTings, an open smart home platform []. A lot of IoT companies emerge like LiFX as smart bulb company [] or TODO. Telecommunication organizations invest in future technologies like 5G which was discussed in chapter 10 of this seminar report. Governments increasingly acknowledge the importance of IoT, the United States supported a Smart Cities Initiative with \$160 million [], the Korean government planned \$5 billion investments in various IoT projects until 2020 []. The investments driven by national institutions as well as aggressive investments by companies in IoT would ``create new business opportunities and substantial social and economic benefits''[]. 

Even though there is no concrete definition what IoT is, there is some consent about the architecture of IoT. A Three layered application stack can be found in various research literature albeit the layers may be named differently they are semantically comparable [fleisch, ju, wortmann, ]. A `thing' layer, which means a hardware-based sensing layer, it has the function to identify objects and collect information through sensors over short-rang and local networks \cite{ju}.\\
The network layer transmits real-time data. It interconnects not only people to `things' but allows also an information flow between `things' autonomously. The data presented by the network layer can be used by companies to provide optimized and personalized services \cite{ju}\\
The application layer is described by Ju et al. as a ``combination of data processing and intelligence analysis to meet the industry needs to realize an intellectualized industry''. The application layer allows companies to achieve ``different types of intelligent application solutions'' as well as the determination of business strategies\cite{ju}.

The Internet of Things has a huge potential. On one side are the customers which enjoy new experiences through the new connected world, on the other side are the businesses getting involved in the IoT market, they hope \cite{ju}.



\section{Business Model Frameworks}
	
	\subsection{Definitions}
	 A \textbf{Business Model} is ``a description of the value a company offers to one or several segments of customers and of the architecture of the firm and its network of partners for creating, marketing and delivering this value and relationship capital, to generate profitable and sustainable revenue streams'' [osterwalder 2005]. The concept of the business model became important in the 1990 as the Internet began to spread and became important since then [22]. There is no commonly accepted view what the business models should include [morris, osterwalder, schweizer]. Achtenhagen et al. stated that there has been a change from ``what business models are'' to ``what business models are for'' \cite{westerlund}. In various literature there seems to exist an agreement that a business model is `the way of doing business' for a particular firm \cite{westerlund}. The heart of each business model stands the goal of minimizing cost and maximizing revenue \cite{ju}.\\
	 Business models are composed of a variety of components. In business models commonly found components are customer segments, value proposition, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partnership and cost structure[ osterwalder 2005]. These Components are the fundamental building blocks of the Business Model Canvas and, thus they are described in detail in Section 1.xyz. \\

	 A \textbf{Business Model Framework} is a tool to help a company in the development of its business model by presenting an overview over the business model components described above \cite{dijkman}.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Definitions
		\cite{bmc}
		\cite{dijkman}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Business 
				\item Business Model 
				\item Business Model Framework
			\end{itemize}
		\item ``Revolutionizing the Business Model''
			\cite{gassmann}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Why design Business Models?
				
				A successful business needs to offer products or services that there is a demand for and thus can be sold to make a profit. In short, a business has to create value. A company needs to have a strategy, a way of conducting business on an operational level that will result in long term financial success, else a business is not viable and will disappear from the market sooner or later.
				A business model can be seen as a logical abstraction describing how the business operates to make a profit. A business models hence is a core factor in deciding whether your business will be driven out of market or prosper. Having a suitable business model is essential. In fact, innovators of business have been found to be 6\% more profitable than product or process innovators (BCG 2008). With the spread of IOT new business models need to be developed to adapt to those technological changes in the environment and seize the opportunities that arise witch such a change. 

				But there seems to be a problem. Few managers can explain their company's business model ad-hoc, let alone define what a business model actually is (Gassman et al.)[1]. They employ a simple conceptualization consisting of four central dimensions: Who, What, How, Value. 
				\item Magic Triangle 

				\begin{itemize}
					\item What is the Magic Triangle?

					The Who, What, How and Value make up the Gassman's magic Triangle. 
					The Who addresses the target customer Group. 
					The What refers to the product or service to those customers. What is the value offered to the customer? 
					The Value explains how the business model is financially viable. How is the value generated? It includes cost and revenue structures.
					The How addresses the process and activities as well as the resources and capabilities that are required for building and distributing the value propositions.

						    \end{center}
						    \caption{the magic triangle}

						\end{figure}
						    \label{label}
					Figure 1.1 shows the constellation of the magic triangle with the ``Who'' node in the middle.
					Gassman argues that reducing the business model to those four components allows for a simple, yet thorough enough view of the business model architecture.



				\end{itemize}
				\item Creating new Business Model

				Creating new business models is not an easy task. It requires thinking outside the box, going beyond convention industry philosophy and can quickly become complex. People that are versed in change management will recognize some of the problem. First, why even come up with a new or improved business model? As long as there are still profits coming in, why take a risk and leave your comfort zone? Competition and environmental factor are always in movement. What works today may not work so well anymore in a few years. The syndrome known as the boiling frog syndrome states that gradually increasing problems are go unnoticed and or not dealt with until until it's too late to tackle them. A frog in pot with water won't jump out if the water is slowly brought to boil and when the water gets too hot for him, his muscles are too weak to jump out. Likewise, a business that has diminishing returns year after year may not be concerned about the the little loss between consecutive year. But when they realize the devastating loss suffered over multiple years there aren't any resources left to tackle the problem and they go bankrupt.

				Another problem is the not invented here syndrome, meaning that ideas not coming from within the company are disregarded solely because they come from the outside. As a consequence, business models should not just be copied from somewhere else but rather bring in external stimuli when generating ideas from within.

				Gassman analyzed 250 business models in different industries from the last 25 years and as a result identified 55 pattern of business models that have served as the basis for new business models in the past. Then, together with selected companies they developed a construction methodology based on the fact that 90\% of all new business models have recombined previousley existing ideas, concepts and  technologies.
				The BMI Navigator is the ready-to-use methodology for coming up with new business models consisting of the following three steps:


				\begin{itemize}
				 	\item Initiation

					Describing the current business model is a good starting point. It creates a common ground for discussing the things that are done well and what needs improvement, and opportunities are open to be exploited. Also it get the participants started thinking in the ways of business models.
					Open-minded team members are essential, preferably from different functions. This allows different viewpoint and thinking outside the box as well as overcoming the prevailing industry logic.
					Recombining existing ideas helps generating new business models. Gassman  condensed for this puropose the 55 business models into a set of pattern cards as shown in figure 1.2. Each card has a title, a description and an example. The goal is applying different cards to the current model to see what would change in this situation. The cards should trigger discussions and act as a stimuli for new innovative ideas.

				 \item Ideation


					\begin{figure}[ht]
						    \begin{center}
						    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Talk11/Figure2.png}
						    \end{center}
						    \caption{pattern card}
						    \label{label}
						\end{figure}



					 \item Integration

					The last step is the integration. It's obvious that a newly genearated idea cannot be implemented instantaneously. New ideas need to be gradually fleshed out into fully operational business models. Considering the new stakeholders, partners and consequences for the market is crucial.


				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}	
	\subsection{Business Model Canvas} 
		The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management tool that was developed by Alexander Osterwalder in his doctoral thesis in 2004 and later published in book form by him and Yves Pigneur \cite{bmc}. The tool supports business developers in gaining an overview about the key factors of their business. There are nine key factors explained by Osterwalder in detail and they are called `building blocks'. All of the building block can be aligned next to each other in a way that visualizes the mechanics of the business models (i.e. the interactions between the building block) and makes it easier to understand and discuss. The analog, pen and paper nature of the business model canvas allows it to be filled out in a team in order to stimulate creativity while finding a suitable business model for the business idea at hand.

		A usual way of filling out the business model canvas is by starting with the targeted `Customer Segments'', then following with the `Value Proposition' to these customers and the `Channels' that allow us to deliver the described value to the customer. The value is not only delivered in a physical but there is an emotional `Customer Relationship' with the customer, too that needs to be considered. In exchange for the proposed value, customers are willing to pay money which make up the `Revenue Streams' of the business model. With this fifth building block, the money-generating revenue side of the business model canvas is complete.

		A business model always includes a cost side. In Osterwalder's canvas, the cost side consists of the following four building blocks: The `Key Resources' are human, financial, physical and intellectual resources that are critical to deliver the proposed value. But resources alone do not create value - they need to be used for `Key Activities' in order for the business model to be viable. As a business owner, the decision of what part of the value you create yourself and what you let other companies do for you is written down in the `Key Partners' building block. The costs induced by resources, activities and partners are finally collected in the `Cost Structure' building block.

		COMMENT: Explain every building block in detail?
	
\section{Available IoT Business Model Frameworks}

In this chapter, we will present and discuss different IoT Business Model Frameworks that are currently available in research papers.

	\subsection{IoT Business Model Patterns (Fleisch et. al)}
		Specific business model patterns can be found in the IoT environment were described in \cite{fleisch}. This is a good starting point to find out what areas an IoT business model framework has to cover. The analysis of 55 distinct business model patterns from \cite{gassmann55} yields two novel business model patterns that can be applied to an IoT business: `Digitally Charged Products' and `Sensor as a Service'.

		The pattern of a `Digitally Charged Products' is described as `classic physical products are charged with a bundle
		of new sensor-based digital services and positioned with new value propositions' in \cite[p. 10]{fleisch}. The components that cab be used and combined are `Physical Freemium' (free digital service with a paid product and offering paid premium services), `Digital Add-on' (digital services are sold to customer on an add-on basis to increase the value of the base product), `Digital Lock-in' (limit the digital compatibility), `Product as Point of Sales', `Object Self Service', `Remote Usage and Condition Monitoring'. 

	\subsection{Adapted business model canvas for IoT (Dijkman et. al)}
		Dijkman et al. analyzed current research literature in order to create a business model framework for IoT applications. They searched for papers that contained the phrasing ``Internet of Things'' together with ``business model'', from the resulting 20 papers were 5 papers selected, only the ones that contained actual business models \cite{dijkman}. Two of the five papers were based on the business model canvas described in Section 1.4.

		Dijkman then identified the building blocks and building block types of business models through the selected papers and interviews with professionals working in the IoT business. Lastly he determined the relative importance of each building block or type through a survey.

		The result from Dijkman et al.'s research can be seen in Figure 1.z. The building blocks observed were equal to the building blocks from the business model canvas described in Section 1.4. The building block types differentiate the framework form classic canvas.

		Based on the interviews and a survey the relative importance of each building block was determined. 

		Dijkman's work showed, that `value proposition' is most important in IoT business models. Also as highly important were `customer relationship' and `key  partnerships' considered.
